## Create a new Skeleton / SvelteKit Project

[Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev/) allows you to create adaptive and accessible interfaces for web apps of any shape or size.

Skeleton recommends using the [Skeleton CLI](https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/get-started) for creating new Skeleton projects (rather than using `pnpm create svelte@latest`). This will automatically scaffold a new SvelteKit application, install Tailwind, configure Skeleton, and more:

```bash
pnpm create skeleton-app@latest
```

```
Welcome to Skeleton ðŸ’€! A UI toolkit for Svelte + Tailwind

```

The CLI will automatically install Skeleton and the Skeleton Tailwind plugin, along with Tailwind CSS and the `@types/node` standard node type definitions to avoid nuisance error messages Typescript projects.

#### Install all dependencies

```
cd my-skeleton-project
pnpm install
```

## Add a Theme

If the Skeleton CLI worked properly, the following items will have been completed automatically. But a quick verification ensures that everything is working correctly.

1.  Register your preferred theme (or themes) in `tailwind.config.ts`:

```ts
plugins: [
	skeleton({
		themes: { preset: ['skeleton'] }
	})
];
```

2.  Open `/src/app.html` and set the active theme using the `data-theme` attribute:

```html
<body data-theme="skeleton"></body>
```

## Start the Dev Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building for Production

To create a production version of your app, run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
